                    There's no such thing as one-size-fits-all when it comes to macro ratios: While your friend may benefit from eating 45 percent carbs, 20 percent fat and 35 percent protein, you might be better off with a different breakdown.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    So how do you know how many grams of healthy fats, fiber-rich carbs and lean proteins should fill your plate? Learning each macro's unique value is a key part of planning for and adhering to a healthy diet, but it all begins with understanding nutrition labels.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Think of the label as a cheat sheet to a food product's nutritional value. Going low-carb? The nutrition label can help you figure out if you're getting enough fiber. Following a restricted-calorie diet? The label can help you calculate a serving size so you can master portion control and finally drop those last five pounds.

                    Chances are the first things that come to mind when you think of protein are bulky biceps and washboard abs. Sure, the muscle-building macro can help you make gym gains, but it's so much more than that: Protein is actually the building block of life.

                <p>
                    The 20 components of protein (aka amino acids) are responsible for regulating your sleep cycle, strengthening your immune system and even growing strong hair and nails, among other crucial functions. What's more, protein may be able to help you get — and stay — lean by keeping you feeling full for longer and slowing down Mother Nature's ill effects on muscle mass as we age.

                    Have you stocked up on cauliflower rice and canceled your beloved Sunday bagel breakfasts? Carbs seem to have become a dietary villain lately. And it's true that refined carbs can thwart your healthy-eating efforts: Simple carbs get digested relatively quickly, leading to a short-lived burst of energy that's followed by a potential energy crash and serious cravings.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Complex carbs, on the other hand, are the hero of this story: They contain fiber, which is broken down at a steadier rate, delivering sustained energy that also keeps you feeling full for longer. So while some refined carbs are basically the nutritional equivalent of the Big Bad Wolf, high-quality, complex carbs are the brick house that can keep your health goals intact.
