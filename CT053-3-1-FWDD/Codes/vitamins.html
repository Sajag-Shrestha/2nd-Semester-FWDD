                    Although it's probably best known for supporting eye health, vitamin A is also crucial for keeping your immune and reproductive systems in tip-top shape. And some research has even linked the nutrient to a lower risk of skin cancer and obesity
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Vitamin A is fat-soluble, which means your body can stockpile it. It's also available via a variety of foods, from carrots to cantaloupe, so you're likely getting enough if you're eating a healthy diet. But those with certain health issues are at risk for deficiency and may benefit from taking a supplement.

                <p>
                    Vitamin B may be the most complex (pun intended) of the singular vitamins, because it's actually a group of eight distinct nutrients. As a whole, though, they're responsible for keeping your metabolism running smoothly and efficiently, and a deficiency in any one of them can seriously affect your health.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The rub? The Bs are water-soluble (as opposed to fat-soluble, like vitamin A), which means your body gets rid of whatever it doesn't use right away, and you constantly need to replenish your stores via food or supplements.

                <p>
                    Think of vitamin C as the power source that keeps your body's natural defense system running.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This mighty little nutrient bolsters your immune system, which helps you fight off potentially harmful germs and bacteria, and it also acts as an antioxidant, combatting the free radicals that might otherwise damage your DNA and lead to chronic illness.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    There's a lot more to know about this important vitamin (no, it can't actually prevent the common cold), and some of it might surprise you â€” like just how much you should be getting on the daily.

                <p>
                    Speaking of immune-boosters, let's talk about vitamin D, the hormone (yes, hormone) that also helps your body build strong bones and teeth and keeps your muscles functioning properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Research has even linked a long-term lack of D to a higher risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes and cancer.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, it's estimated that billions of people don't get enough of this nutrient on a daily basis, and certain people are especially at risk for deficiency based on where they live, what they eat and how old they are.

                    Vitamin E may not be as popular as its buzzier peers (ahem, vitamin D), but it's just as essential for good health.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Getting enough of the fat-soluble vitamin is linked to cognitive health and immune support thanks to the nutrient's antioxidant properties.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the flipside, not meeting your daily recommended amount of E on a regular basis can lead to impaired vision and decreased immune function, among other concerns.

                    Yes, calcium is often touted for helping build strong bones, but it's also responsible for maintaining healthy blood pressure levels.

                <p>
                    While calcium is naturally found in foods you probably already eat like dairy, many Americans don't seem to be meeting their daily calcium needs across the board. That's where a supplement can help.
